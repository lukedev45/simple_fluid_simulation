# Simple Fluid Simulation (Python)

A small, self-contained **2D fluid / “ink in water” style** simulation written in **Python**. This repo is meant to be an approachable playground for experimenting with fluid-like motion, parameter tuning, and simple real-time visualisation.

## What this project does

- Simulates fluid-like flow on a 2D domain (think: dye/ink advecting through a velocity field)
- Visualises the evolving state in real time
- Keeps the codebase minimal so you can *actually* read it and modify it

This is primarily an educational / visual project rather than a “perfect physics” CFD solver.
